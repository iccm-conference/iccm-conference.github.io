title: International Conference on Cognitive Modelling
---

The International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM) is the premier
 conference for research on computational models and computation-based
 theories of human behavior. ICCM is a forum for presenting, discussing,
 and evaluating the complete spectrum of cognitive modeling approaches,
 including connectionism, symbolic modeling, dynamical systems, Bayesian
 modeling, and cognitive architectures. ICCM includes basic and applied
 research, across a wide variety of domains, ranging from low-level perception
 and attention to higher-level problem-solving and learning.
