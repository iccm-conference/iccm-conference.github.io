# Next Conference

In 2021, the ICCM conference will once again be happening online, and will once again be co-located with the MathPsych conference.  As usual, submissions can either be 2-page extended abstracts or 6-page papers, using the same formatting guidelines as the CogSci conference.  Submissions will be accepted as either talks or posters.  

For talks, authors will make pre-recorded videos and then be available for a scheduled live Q & A period during the conference time itself.  For posters, there will be an online poster session where there will be live Q&A, as well as viewing the poster and a short pre-recorded video.

 - Submission deadline: May 7, 2021.
 - Conference dates: July 1 - July 12.
 - Website (for submissions and more information): [https://mathpsych.org](https://mathpsych.org)
