# Next Conference

ICCM 2019 will be held in Montreal, Canada, from July 19-22, 2019.  The main website is: http://mathpsych.org/conferences/2019/



# Submission Information

The submission deadline is April 22, 2019.

Conference Registration and MathPsych Submissions can be found here:
https://www.conftool.com/mathpsych-iccm2019

ICCM Paper, Poster, and Workshop submissions can be found here:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccm2019

There are four types of regular submissions. Submissions may be made by researchers, faculty, post-docs, graduate students and undergraduate students. Any one person may present only one paper, but may also be a co-author of other papers, or may also be an invited speaker or symposium participant. This rule applies across the conferences, i.e. when you are the presenting author of a MathPsych talk, you cannot also be the presenting author of an ICCM talk.

1) MathPsych Abstracts: 250 word maximum abstracts of research you wish to present during the conference. They may be submitted by regular SMP members, student SMP members, and non-members. Submissions will be considered for both talks and posters.

2) ICCM Papers: refereed papers of up to 6 pages. If a submission is accepted to be published as a paper, the paper will be presented at the conference either as a talk or as a poster.
Submissions must be sized 8.5 x 11 inches, with NO headers/footers and NO page numbers. If there are any special fonts required (Korean, Japanese, etc), these must be included with the submission. The final submission must be in PDF format. The template files for submissions are available at https://github.com/rlevy/cogsci-template (the same formats as used by the Cognitive Science Society conference); please do not edit the margins or font settings of these files.

3) ICCM Posters: refereed poster abstracts of up to 2 pages. If accepted, the corresponding poster will be presented at the conference in the joint poster session. There will be boards available for poster hanging. The maximum poster size is 4 x 4 feet (120 x 120 cm).
Submissions must be sized 8.5 x 11 inches, with NO headers/footers and NO page numbers. If there are any special fonts required (Korean, Japanese, etc), these must be included with the submission. The final submission must be in PDF format. The template files for submissions are available at https://github.com/rlevy/cogsci-template (the same formats as used by the Cognitive Science Society conference); please do not edit the margins or font settings of these files. Note: the templates and sample papers mention a one-page limit for posters, this is incorrect. The limit is two pages.


4) Tutorials/Workshops:
These proposals should be at most 2 pages and include a brief description of the aim of the workshop/tutorial, the teaching methods, the program, the presenters, and the intended duration (full day or half day). A tutorial or workshop will provide conference participants with the opportunity to gain new insights, knowledge, and skills from a broad range of areas in the field of cognitive modeling. Tutorial topics will be presented in a taught format and are likely to range from practical guidelines to theoretical issues or software. Workshops give an opportunity for in-depth discussion on a specific topic important for cognitive modeling. Tutorials have been held many times before at both MathPsych and ICCM conferences, and this yearâ€™s program will be modeled after them and after the series held at the Cognitive Science Conference; please see previous years for examples. Most tutorials should be at the introductory graduate school level or slightly higher. That is, the tutorials should be accessible to postgraduate students, but should assume a first degree in one of the cognitive sciences.
The format for tutorial and workshop submissions is the same as for ICCM poster submissions.
