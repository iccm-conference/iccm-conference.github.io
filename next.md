# Next Conference

Due to COVID-19, ICCM 2020 is a virtual online-only event!  We are again co-located with the Society for Mathematical Psychology meeting http://mathpsych.org/conferences/2020/

The conference itself is held online at https://virtual.mathpsych.org/

The ICCM talks will be done as pre-recorded 15-minute videos, which will be available for viewing starting on July 20, 2020, along with an online discussion forum for asynchronous questions and answers.  Each day there will be a set of 4-5 talks which are highlighted, and two days later will be the online live question and answer period from 12:00 to 13:00 EDT.

The ICCM posters will be done as pre-recorded 5-minute videos, with an accompanying forum for discussion.

The overall ICCM program, along with links to the papers themselves, is available here: https://iccm-conference.neocities.org/2020/index.html
